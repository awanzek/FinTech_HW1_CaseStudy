# RIPPLE - RippleNET - A GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN SOLUTION

## Overview and Origin
Reference: Ripple Company Website [ripple.com](https://ripple.com/)

* **Name of company:**

    Ripple (XRP) is the company to be presented in this case study. They have technologies they are affiliated with and maintain such as RippleNET and XRP Ledger. ([ripple.com](https://ripple.com/))

* **When was the company incorporated?**

    Ripple initially began in 2012. Since then they have grown, developed their integrated global payment system, and become a leader in the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency world. ([ripple.com](https://ripple.com/))

* **Who are the founders of the company?**

    Brad Garlinghouse is CEO and founder of the company. David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb, Chris Larsen, and Arthur Britto were also original founders of Ripple. In addition to the founders, there is a talented team of software engineers and global sales and operations management professionals behind Ripple. ([Kauflin, 2019](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2019/02/04/the-10-biggest-fintech-companies-in-america-2019/#4cbf3d5832b9)) ([ripple.com](https://ripple.com/))


* **How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**

    The concept of Ripple's RippleNET was developed based on the company's founders identifying difficulties in payment systems. With the emergence of blockchain technology, Garlinghouse, Schwartz and the founding team decided to apply the technology to digital assets. The goal: "enable financial institutions to send money across borders, instantly, reliably and for fractions of a penny." ([ripple.com](https://ripple.com/)) 

* **How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**

    Ripple is funded by venture capital (VC) money and other private investors around the world. Several contributors include: Accenture, SBI Group, and Santander among others. Funding company Santander, now also runs on ripple, as do major companies such as American Express and Moneygram. ([ripple.com](rhttps://ripple.com/) )
    
    Ripple recieves funding from direct sale of its cryptocurrency coins. For example they sold $500 million worth of XRP coins that they then invested in Moneygram ([Forbes, 2020](https://www.forbes.com/companies/ripple/?list=fintech/#206f5f313997)). Recently, reports have announced that Ripple has achieved a $10 billion dollar evaluation after recieving $200 million in investment funding ([Browne, 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/20/ripple-creator-of-xrp-crypotocurrency-is-now-valued-at-10-billion.html)).



## Business Activities:

* **What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**

    Ripple's goal is to solve the finanical problem of global payments and transactions. In doing so they have developed RippleNet which was designed to connect financial institutions around the world and allow for secure and less expensive movement of funds and payments between them. ([Ripple-Overview](https://ripple.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RippleNet-Overview.pdf))

* **Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**
    
    Ripple's primary customer is financial insitutions that deal in large payments and transactions. These financial instutuions are most likely to desire technology that increases speed and security as well as providing an international payment network. Based on Ripple's current customer base, their is a large potential market of customers as there are many financial institutions in every country. Currently ripple is providing payment options in over 40 currencies world wide. Thus, if every country had only 1 major financial institution which mananged international payments, that would be 195 customers ([World Atlas](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/how-many-countries-are-in-the-world.html)). Granted, there are multiple financial institutions in every country, more currencies to connect, and plenty of room for Ripple to grow. The remaining factor is soley competition in the blockchain and cryptocurrency domain that services global payment systems. ([Ripple-Overview](https://ripple.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RippleNet-Overview.pdf))
    
    Ripple's primary competitor is SWIFT, an international organization that connects over 10,000 financial insitutions worldwide. This organization runs on less effective, more traditional technology and communication methods for transferring 25 million transaction messages a day. The downside SWIFT's process consists of "regulatory oversight, compliance checks and other layers of protection, and is facilitated via a complex series of service agreements". ([Castillo,2018](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2018/09/04/ripples-trillion-dollar-man/#611091387324)) 
    
    So what does Ripple offer that they don't? Secure and instant transmission of funds. But Ripple is not the only one who offers the security and speed of blockchain technology in banking transactions. Stellar (XLM), which also provides a blockchain money transfer system, has similar goals. In fact, one of the original founders, McCaleb, split in 2014 and used Ripple as a baseframe and founded Stellar. It seems that with the original reputation, Ripple still has more backing and trust in its technologies vs. forked startup Stellar. ([Castillo,2018](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2018/09/04/ripples-trillion-dollar-man/#611091387324)) ([ripple.com](https://ripple.com/)) 
    
    One unfair advantage that is potentially being used by Ripple, is the fact that it is considered to be a more "centralized" cryptocurrency. This may be to their advantage, because centralized banks may be more willing to adopt technology that is only appearing as decentralized, but is more consistent with the concepts of traditional banking and control. Whereas banks and financial institutions may be opposed to truely "decentralized" cryptocurrencies that exist. There is debate on this topic in the crypto-community among Bitcoin and Ethereum supporters. Ripple founder, Schwartz has tried to down play this view that Ripple is "centralized" and entice those seeking total decentralization. He has encouraged more people to get on board and start using Ripple as a building block, similar to how there is a multitude of Ethereum Tokens built on top of the Ethereum network. ([Castillo, 2018](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2018/09/04/ripples-trillion-dollar-man/#611091387324))     


* **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)**

    Ripple is currently using its cryptocurrency technology, XRP Ledger to create and manage its services such as RippleNET. XRP Ledger is a decentralized and cryptographic network. The coin XRP is contained on the XRP Ledger. XRP Ledger offers many items including "secure, adaptable cryptography, smart contracts, a fast consensus algorithm, censorship-resistant transaction processing". ([XRP Ledger](https://xrpl.org/xrp-ledger-overview.html))



## Landscape:

* **What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**

    Ripple is in the Cryptocurrency and Blockchain domain of FinTech. This is evidenced by its use of blockchain-like technology to create and develop a cryptocurrency platform that can be used in financial transactions. Note, Ripple is blockchain-like because it uses its own private ledger and consensus mechanism in its server network to verify and record transactions ([Frankenfield,2019](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ripple-cryptocurrency.asp) ). So yes, it's blockchain but Ripple basically has its own unique blockchain. ([Forbes, 2019](https://www.forbes.com/companies/ripple/?list=fintech/#206f5f313997)) 

* **What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?** 

    In the Cryptocurrency and Blockchain domain, there have been major changes in use cases and a large growth in number of companys and ICOs. As discussed in an article sourced from MDPI, online payments and transactions have become widespread and are in high demand. However, older options, such as PayPal, for online payments did not until recently have the technology of blockchain which is essential to the definition and use of cryptocurrency. In the past 10 years the advancement of blockchain has allowed cryptocurrency to become a desireable digital payment method. Cyrptocurrency is decentralized and allows peer-to-peer or business-to-business transactions worldwide to occur with high levels of trust and security and the transaction is tracked in the blockchain. Now there are some key things to consider that influence trends and innovations. Those being financial regulations, global acceptance and use, and blockchain exchange security. ([Hassani, Huang & Silva,2018](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/2/4/34))
    
    In terms of financial regulations blockchain and cryptocurrency have become more accepted. Major financial institutions and banks are beginning to adapt or support use cases. Likewise individuals are more accepting of virtual currencies and some countries have even been forced to turn to cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin when their currency and goverenments have collapsed. ([Rollcall, 2019](https://www.rollcall.com/2019/09/10/venezuelans-use-cryptocurrency-to-bypass-corruption-inflation/)) Blockchain security on exchanges has also been an issue addressed in the past 10 years. For isntance, major exchange hacks such as the Mt. Gox have prompted developers and researchers to find ways to improve security and privacy. 

    Other major advancements include technologies building on top of basic blockchain such as Tangle and Hashgraph. Tangle is part of a company called IOTA (IOTA coin) they have a "directed acyclic graph" that allows it to achieve faster micro-payments and erase the requirement for any transaction fees. Not require transaction fees and increasing speed are major developments in blockchain as Bitcoin and others have large transaction fees and times that make them less economical to deal with. Hashgraph also uses directed acyclic graph and "uses gossip for achieving consensus". It allows for nodes in the network to gather and share information with new nodes and pass it on. It is highly efficient but is currently being held in its privately owned state. So its impact on blockchain advancement has yet to be seen. ([Hassani, Huang & Silva, 2018](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/2/4/34)). 

    Other advancements in modern technology such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Google Trends, and Big Data have also proppelled blockchain. AI for example may be able to help blockchain become more secure and more energy efficient. Google Trends has allowed for tracking of the way that people are responding to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Based on the following Figure 1. Google Trends since 2016 ([Hassani, Huang & Silva,2018](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/2/4/34)), in the past 5 years searchs and interest in cyrtocurrency have spiked.


* **What are the other major companies in this domain?**

    Other major companies in the blockchain and cryptocurrency domain of FinTech include IOTA, as mentioned above with its tangle technology, and Coinbase, referenced in Forbes articles cited for this case study. Coinbase is one of the 10 biggest companies in the space and has developed from an online storage wallet to an insitutional online trading platform for cryptocurrencies. ([Kauflin, 2019](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2019/02/04/the-10-biggest-fintech-companies-in-america-2019/#4cbf3d5832b9))

    Another major player that is stepping onto the scene is Libra, Facebook's own cryptocurrency coin. ([Reiff, 2020](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/most-important-cryptocurrencies-other-than-bitcoin/)) There is an endless number of coins being created and produced by companies around the world. However, the top coins Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple still dominate the cryptocurrency markets. 

## Results

* **What has been the business impact of this company so far?** 

    To date Ripple has proved to be a desireable financial transaction solution. They have onboarded many major financial institutions, including American Express, Santander, SBI, Moneygram, and PNC, to their RippleNet global payment network and system. CEO of Santander states "Customers who were not doing international transfers are now using the service, customers who were using international transfer are now doing it more..." ([ripple.com](https://ripple.com/ripplenet)). In otherwords, they have created a connective and useful tool for businesses and institutions to connect and transfer funds securely. THe impact of this is the increased number of financial transactions and the reduced amount of time. This beneficial result allows increased business activity and quality control which should lead to an even more global network of businesses, finance, and technology. ([ripple.com](https://ripple.com/))

* **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?** 

    Metrics that are critical to assessing blockchain and cryptocurrency success include functional aspects of: speed, trust, cost, and accesability. In addition market aspects such as coin price, circulating supply, and market cap in regards to its price movement and value can show success. 
    
    Based on the functional metrics of, Ripple is solid. Ripple provides speed: a Ripple transaction takes 3-4 seconds (even faster than most other cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH) vs. a traditional 3-5 business days. Ripple provides high levels of trust: Ripple has a distrubted network of nodes tracking and validating transactions and has been around 8 years, much longer than some of its competitors. Ripple reduces cost: transaction fees on the ripple network are low and they prioritize efficiency to reduce cost. Ripple is accessible: Ripple is global and provides transactions between 40 different currencies worldwide and connects global financial institutions via RippleNet. ([ripple.com](https://ripple.com/xrp/)) 
    
    Based on the market and price aspects, Ripple is ideal in the fact that there is a finite coin supply and a large market cap. However the circulating supply is large, so there are plenty of coins to go around. This is likely why Ripple is a top performing and widely used coin, but doesn't show for it in its price per coin, coming in at only about $0.20 at the time of this case study. Thus in terms of price value per coin, Ripple is not as strong as its competitors such as BTC and ETH, but it does surpass Stellar, and come in similar to IOTA ([ripple.com](https://ripple.com/xrp/)) ([coinbase.com](https://www.coinbase.com/))

* **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**

    Compared to other blockchain and cryptocurrency payment systems Ripple is definitely ahead in its implementation of its network and protocol. As stated, Ripple has a strong history and track record, with which they have built trust with major financial institutions. In fact "all ledgers closed without issue since inception". ([ripple.com](https://ripple.com/xrp/)) In terms of network development, though, Ripple may need to further advance or add to its network new technologies, such as tangle, which IOTA has implemented, and hashgraph. Overall, Ripple has captured a strong network so far and also recieved strong private funding to continue its competitive development. Ideally, in anaylzing their competitors use of new technologies, Ripple will use their funding to continue to build on their strong foundation of XRP and RippleNET. ([ripple.com](https://ripple.com/))

## Recommendations

* **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**

    To help Ripple maintain its competitive edge, I would suggest continuing to focus on banking institutions and maintain its partially centralized appeal. I would also suggest to make a spin off of RippleNet for institutions and possibly develop some type of system for individuals to almost have a "bank account" with Ripple as though Ripple itself is the bank that controls and services all the other major financial institutions and banks. This way, in a sense, the people would be relying more in Ripple, in theory if this application was decentralized, they would be relying in themselves. They would also have the banks and institutions relying on them in a reverse way through Ripple. I am not sure how well this would work though, as Ripple has a strong target market of major financial institutions, while other cryptocurrencies are more focused on law, real-estate, social networks, entertainment and other sectors of transaction issues. 
    
    Regardless, if they can find some way to make Ripple coins more common place among individuals and push them towards using them in purchases and spending on a daily basis they would truly be a common place and global currency. For the purposes of this case study, I propose myRipple. myRipple will be an application that allows individuals to send coins directly and also to store and lend coins for themselves and others.  

* **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**

    Offering a service like myRipple, that can target everyday transactions and spending would benefit Ripple by growing its network. If you view each individual as a node in the network, gaining the trust and compliance of individuals will allow for a large network of available nodes for operations and transactions. I also think making a more decentralized aspect, like the proposed myRipple, will erase the view of cryptocurrency supporters that Ripple is "centralized" and not truly promoting the goal of the initial cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Having a product or service that is more decentralized than their RippleNET that services a "centralized" banking and institution network, will hopefully allow for an increased demand and value of XRP.

* **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**

    The new myRipple product and service would have to utilize 

* **Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**
